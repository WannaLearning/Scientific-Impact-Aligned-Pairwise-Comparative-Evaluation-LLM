# Scientific-Impact-Aligned-Pairwise-Comparative-Evaluation-LLM
We propose a two-step training strategy using reinforcement learning to train a Scientific Impact-Aligned Pairwise Comparative Evaluation LLM, which can generate the relative quality relationship and scores that are well-aligned with papersâ€™ scientific impact.
